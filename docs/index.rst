Welcome to Gateway
==================

Welcome to Gateway's documentation. This documentation is divided into differents parts.
I recommend that you get started with the :ref:`installation` and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`.

Gateway depends on external libraries: the `Flask`_ micro framework and the `python-rq`_ library (Redis Queue).

- `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_
- `python-rq <http://www.python-rq.org>`_

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org
.. _python-rq: http://www.python-rq.org
